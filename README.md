# Conclusion
This class was really interesting, even though I don't really like programming or anything related to this, 
I was so excited to see what we were going to learn that day.
Besides the topics we saw, I liked that the teacher gave stickers to anyone who would interect in class, even when we were having classes online he'd say that he'd give to us the sitckers once we were in the classroom.
